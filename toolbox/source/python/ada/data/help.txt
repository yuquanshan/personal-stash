ada

DESCRIPTION
    Ada is a collection of tools, including date, python-syntax expresssion
evaluator, and more to be added in the future. The name "ada" is a shortened
version of "ask date" because it was originally designed to answer
datetime-related questions, such as "the date of next next next Tuesday",
"what is the date 10 days before", etc.
